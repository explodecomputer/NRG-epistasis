There is evidence for epistasis being widespread, if of lower importance to additive effects

- Bloom 2013,
- Baryshnikova 2010 Quantitative analysis of fitness and genetic interactions in yeast on a genome scale, 
- Martin 2007 Distrobutions of epistasis in microbes, 
- DRYGIN data set - Costanzo 2010 The genetic landscape of a cell

There is also evidence that epistasis increases with increasing organism complexity (Sanjuan 2006). So why do we not see epistasis in higher organisms?

- Epistasis is larger when effects are smaller?
- LD
- Power
- Epistatic effects are relatively larger when genetic effects are smaller
-- Woods Second-order selection for evolvability in a large ecoli popn 
-- Velenich (under submission)

- Additive x additive is maximised at frequencies of 0.5 x 0.5. Most human variation is at lower frequencies


============================
============================




There has not been much epistasis found. Is this because 
- We are looking in the wrong place and have not found it yet
- It is too difficult
- It does not exist

Can we make inference on this?


============================
============================


How useful is the X1xX2 interaction test? 
Assume Dom x Dom model and calculate multiplicative or AxA test for different allele frequencies.


============================
============================


Look at methods that Wenhua collates - find all citing papers and see how often they are used and if they find anything.


============================
============================


Why is epistasis worth worrying about?
- Additive effects are actually locally interacting epistatic effects in haplotype blocks
- Distribution of effect frequencies


============================
============================


Bloom paper
- Large proportion of additive effects discovered
- Large proportion of epistasis not discovered
- Most epistasis discovered has marginal effects
- But interactions between marginal effects account for a small proportion of all epistasis even though it's relatively well powered due to low multiple testing.
