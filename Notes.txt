There is evidence for epistasis being widespread, if of lower importance to additive effects

- Bloom 2013,
- Baryshnikova 2010 Quantitative analysis of fitness and genetic interactions in yeast on a genome scale, 
- Martin 2007 Distrobutions of epistasis in microbes, 
- DRYGIN data set - Costanzo 2010 The genetic landscape of a cell

There is also evidence that epistasis increases with increasing organism complexity (Sanjuan 2006). So why do we not see epistasis in higher organisms?

- Epistasis is larger when effects are smaller?
- LD
- Power
- Epistatic effects are relatively larger when genetic effects are smaller
-- Woods Second-order selection for evolvability in a large ecoli popn 
-- Velenich (under submission)

- Additive x additive is maximised at frequencies of 0.5 x 0.5. Most human variation is at lower frequencies



EXAMPLES

Psoriasis (skin condition, 2.5%, h2=60-90%)
Interaction test
- Pairwise between top SNPs
- Null = Multiplicative at each locus combined on odds ratio; Alt = Null + Multiplicative AxD interaction
- Replicated
- ERAP1 only has an additive effect when at least one risk allele at HLA-C is present
- Searched for epistasis amongst all SNPs and HLA-C, nothing else significant found
- Mostly additive


Ankylosing spondylitis (inflammatory arthritis, prevalence = 5/1000, ht=90%)
Interaction test
- Pairwise between top SNPs
- Same test as Psoriasis
- Replicated twice
- ERAP1 only has an effect when at least one risk allele at HLA_C is present
- Mostly additive

There has not been much epistasis found. Is this because 
- We are looking in the wrong place and have not found it yet
- It is too difficult
- It does not exist

Can we make inference on this?
