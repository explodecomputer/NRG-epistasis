Abstract

Genome wide association (GWA) studies have become the focus of the statistical analysis of complex traits in humans, successfully shedding light on several aspects of genetic architecture and also biological aetiology.  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are usually modelled as having linear, cumulative, and independent effects on the phenotype. Though evidently a useful approach, it is often argued that this is not a realistic biological model and that interactions between SNPs should be included. In this review we discuss the relevance of epistasis in the context of GWA studies, recent advances in methodology, evidence of its contribution to complex traits in humans, and potential hazards in the interpretation of statistical interaction terms.


Introduction
============

Complex traits or diseases are those that are influenced by multiple environmental and genetic factors. It is a safe generalisation that all those diseases that have a significant impact on human health are shown to be complex at the population scale. Indeed, even classically "Mendelian" diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, are at some level complex because numerous genetic effects are involved in modifying the breadth and severity of symptoms. Arguably the most important empirical result to emerge from GWA studies over the past decade is an indication of what it means for a trait to be "complex", demonstrating that the mutational target size for any particular trait across the genome is very large and that the additive genetic variation is comprised of very many effects, each of very small effect sizes.

One can estimate the proportion of the phenotypic variance of a trait that is attributed to additive genetic effects through several methods using samples of related individuals. Estimating how much of the phenotypic variation attributed to all genetic effects (including dominance and epistasis) is not possible for humans. GWA studies are typically performed on traits that have been shown to have a non-zero narrow-sense heritability, the logic being that there is additive genetic variation in the trait and this can be dissected into additive effects across the genome. In this context, it is already known that the additive genetic architecture is complex. Detecting non-additive genetic effects imposes an assumption that beyond the additive component of genetic variation for which there is empirical evidence exists more complex components for which empirical evidence cannot be obtained. The measurable gap between the variance explained by all known additive effects and h2 is termed the "missing heritability". The proportion of the genetic variation that might exist beyond additive variance might be termed the "unknown heritability". 

In essence, there is no strict hypothesis-driven precedent for searching for epistasis as there is for additive effects, and while we have still yet to fully understand the architecture of additive genetic effects the modelling complexity for epistatic effects is much greater. So why does anybody care about epistasis?


To which scientific question(s) is epistasis the answer?
========================================================

The missing heritability?
-------------------------
By strict definition, epistasis does not have a role to play in the problem of the missing heritability. The missing heritability pertains to the problem that there are insufficient additive effects discovered to account for the additive genetic variance estimated to exist for that trait. SNPs that interact can have marginal additive (and dominance) effects, but the key to declaring that they interact is that they have an epistatic effect that does not contribute to additive genetic variation. In principle, the total additive genetic variance accounted for by interacting SNPs can be captured by a standard GWA study searching for additive effects that is suitably powered.

The missing heritability emerges from two variables, the tally of genetic effects uncovered and the estimate of the trait's h2, and in each case epistasis may have a subtle part to play. Firstly, some theoretical studies postulate that if, for some interacting loci, the epistatic variance is large compared to the additive variance, searching for epistatic effects might be one way to uncover loci with additive variance with more power than searching for the additive effects directly. Such an instance might arise if the trait has a large mutational target and is under direct selection. Thus, an increase in the number of interacting loci discovered may very well increase the proportion of additive variance uncovered.

Secondly, because the direct estimation of non-additive genetic variation is almost always intractible, its contribution to the resemblence between relatives is unknown. Thus, it is possible that under certain experimental designs heritability estimates are inflated through contamination from non-additive variation. To what extent is this realistically a problem and how reliably can it be measured? A recent theoretical study (Zuk 2011) gained much attention after demonstrating that redundancy amongst biological pathways could create an illusion of additive genetic variance in twin studies provided. Indeed it is a known issue in such study designs that though it is not the most parsimonious model, a combination of non-additive variation and common environmental variation can lead to a significant additive parameter, further demonstrated theoretically by Stringer et al 2013. To overcome this problem one can attempt to use family-based studies to estimate additive effects directly, and one can use contrasts between different types of relatives. For example, full siblings will share 0.5 additive variance and 0.25 dominance variance, while parent-offspring will share 0.5 additive and 0 dominance variance. If the correlation between degree of shared additive variation and phenotypic similarity is high across all types of relatives then this would be strong evidence for heritability estimates being uncontaminated by non-additive variance. Height shows consistent estimates of heritability between twin studies and family studies, but h2 estimates for BMI are much higher from twin studies than from family studies, suggesting that height is probably mostly influenced by additive effects and non-additive effects may play an important role in BMI.


Elucidating biological mechanisms?
----------------------

Suppose one has identified two polymorphisms, from independent regions of the genome, that exhibit a statistical interaction. What biological information can this tell us?

functions of mutations
relationships between independent genomic features
construction of pathways
genetic redundancy

Are there examples of interactions leading to understanding?
Are there examples where this hasn't improved understanding?

Discussion
==========

## Scale effects, haplotype effects, linked loci, liability vs observed scale

Should we be looking for epistasis?

For:
1. They may explain missing variation
2. They may indicate the evolutionary persistence of additive effects
3. It seems to be widespread in artificial genetic variation
4. Knowing how independent regions interact statistically could shed light on biological mechanisms

Against:
1. The additive model is simple and effective
2. There are no non-additive models in animal breeding but there is extremely good progress in morphological selection
3. Detection of epistatic effects is very hard, and additive models are already underpowered
4. We expect less variance to be contributed by non-additive effects based on Taylor series expansions, narrow sense heritability estimates, etc.

=======

The genetic variance of complex traits is typically comprised of very many polymorphisms, each with a very small effect. Herein lies the most parsimonious explanation for the problem of the missing heritability, and informs that association studies need to increase in size dramatically in order to detect more variants. Supposing that non-additive variance is similarly comprised of numerous small effects, the statistical power to detect them is, in principle, much lower than that of detecting additive effects for a number of reasons.

- Linkage disequilibrium
The variance explained by a SNP detected in a GWAS is unlikely to be equal to the variance explained by the true causal variant that is being tagged by the marker. The additive variance at the observed marker will decrease linearly with decreasing LD r^2 between itself and the causal variant, thus if effect sizes are small then GWAS is dependent upon there being high LD between causal variants and observed SNPs. However, the decrease in dominance variance with LD r^2 is quadratic, thus the dependence on high LD between observed SNPs and unobserved causal variants is much higher when detecting dominance effects. Extending this to two loci, the additive x additive variance is linearly dependent upon sufficient LD at two independent positions (reduces quadratically with LD r^2), and dominance x dominance variance is quadratically dependent at both positions (reduces to the fourth power with LD r^2). The consequence of these constraints is that any given SNP chip has substantially greater coverage of the genome when searching for additive effects than when searching for epistatic effects. To overcome this problem one needs larger sample sizes or more dense genotyping (or sequencing) to identify non-additive effects at the same power as additive effects.

- Curse of dimensionality / significance thresholds
The search for additive effects is performed in a single dimensional search space, that is, our search is constrained to the number of markers in the experiment. In principle, searching for epistasis involves expanding from one dimension to two or more dimensions, thus the parameter space increases exponentially. This problem, where any signal becomes drowned out by the noise, is known as the "curse of dimensionality". There are several strategies that one can use to scan the genome for epistatic effects, but they typically involve expansion of the search space and a higher multiple testing penalty than is required for detecting non-epistatic effects. Therefore, in order to obtain the same power of detection as searching for additive effects, the sample size must increase and/or one depends on the epistatic variance being larger.
